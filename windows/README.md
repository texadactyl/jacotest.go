## One-time (only) Pre-requisites:

The following steps must be taken prior to use of jacotest:

* Ensure that there is a go\bin subdirectory under the user's home directory (%USERPROFILE%).
* Ensure that the %GOPATH% user environment variable = %USERPROFILE%\go.
* Ensure that %USERPROFILE%\go\bin is an element of the user %PATH% environment variable.
* After this is done, logout and then re-login.

## One-time (only) Scripts

* show_exes.bat - Starting in the user's home directory, show all JACOTEST.EXE files.
* del_exes.bat - Starting in the user's home directory, delete all JACOTEST.EXE files. Alternatively, if you ran show_exes.bat, you can manually delete the JACOTEST.EXE files based on the screen output.
* Execute this command line from the jacobin or jacotest.go src directory: go clean -cache

## When Updating Jacotest

* cd into the jacotest.go directory, whever you keep it.
